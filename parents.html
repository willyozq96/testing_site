        <p>
            Show & Tell is an interactive learning tool where your child can explore and pick up new words.
            Children learn by observing, listening and exploring at a young age. It is essential for children to be
            curious, interested, engaged and motivated once they start school.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 3 easy steps - choose, upload and click, your child can benefit from learning new words and
            pronouncing them, which aids them in better reading, writing and communication skills.
            Show & Tell can also act as an alternative material, aside from the traditional books and
            formal lessons at school, to support your child's learning.

        <p>
            With the use of Show & Tell, parents can support your child's learning by stimulating conversations.
            By engaging in conversations with your kids, it helps to develop a strong bond, while supporting
            their cognitive development and improving their social and interaction skills.

        <p>
            Show & Tell provides a window of opportunity to support your child's learning by building
            great knowledge from a young age. Since children are naturally intrigued, they can absorb new
            information quickly with the text and audio aid that we provide - Visual and Auditory learning
            styles.
        </p>

        <p>
            As parents have a tremendous influence on their children, parents can understand how
            a child learns and improve on how to teach them as they grows. Thus, creating a great potential
            for the impact of positive development influences.
